# Terraria
A Modified version of decompiled source code from a very very very old version of Terraria (You need the Content folder from the original build to run this)
- Added an FPS counter
- Moved the life meter around
- Ctrl X-M enable different cheats (Ctrl + Z to enable cheats first)
- Ctrl + U to uncap framerate
